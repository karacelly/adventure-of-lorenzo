# Adventure of Lorenzo
The Adventure of Lorenzo is a third person shooter game developed using Unity. The game is based on the legend of a famous special agent from Bluejack Defense System, Lorenzo Synthesis Thirty. The story takes place in a distant planet called Underworld, where researchers of Bluejack Defense System have detected the presence of tons of core items, which are needed to strengthen the weakened Bluejack Defense System. Unfortunately, the planet is very hostile and the only option is to send their top special agent, Lorenzo Synthesis Thirty, to retrieve the core items.

## Gameplay
The game starts in the upper city area, where the player will encounter three enemy types: Kyle, Warrior, and Drone. The player must defeat these enemies to progress towards the end of the upper city area, where a closed door connects to the basement area. The door will only open if the player collects all 9 core items.

The basement area consists of some corridors and a big square room. There will be only one type of enemy, which is Mech. The player will encounter one or more mechs in the corridor and two or more mechs in the big room, which serves as the boss room. After defeating the boss, the third dialogue will be triggered and the door connecting the big room to the spaceship area will open.

In the spaceship area, the player will find an outward facing spaceship which they can enter to complete the game.
